## My experience:
### I  started my career with a small business related to real estate investments in Russia. 
### Several years ago I expanded my business interests; in addition to real estate, I do photo-video shooting and editing.
### I recently became interested in website development. This became an interesting continuation of my work with photo and video material.

### In addition to interesting work, I want to get the opportunity to work remotely. I travel a lot and would like to be able to do it even more.
